 # 🏥 AutoMediCare — AI Powered Healthcare Assistant

AutoMediCare is an AI-driven healthcare web application developed as a minor
project by 3rd year Computer Science Engineering students. The platform provides
users with instant AI-based symptom analysis, urgency detection, doctor
recommendations, and appointment booking through a modern web interface.

This project demonstrates the practical use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
full-stack development to solve real-world healthcare problems.
